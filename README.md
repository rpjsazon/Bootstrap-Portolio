## How I build my first bootstrap ( responsive ) webpage?

### 1. I added a Nav and customized the color.

Reference: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/navs/

* I added the logo style and hover effect when cursor point on the links.

### 2. By adding jumbotron, I makes the website interesting.

### 3. For my about and contact section, I created (1) div class "row" and add (3). One for my photo and then nested two column and set it as "d-block" (display="block") in bootstrap to achieved this look.

### 4. Adding bootstrap card is easy. Just make sure you put the grid layout correctly.

* I added blur effect when hovering to the cards.
* For future development, I will add a carousel to make it more interesting.
